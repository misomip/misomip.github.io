## The Marine Ice Sheet Intercomparison Project
Global sea-level rise is one of the most discussed potential consequences of global warming. The most uncertain aspect of such future sea-level change has to do with the marine based ice sheets. Despite its potential importance, current generation global climate models are unable to simulate sea-level change arising from ice sheet-ocean interaction. As a step towards remediating this situation, we are bringing together the international modeling community through workshops and model intercomparison projects. Such moddelling research will lay the groundwork for including ice sheet-ocean interaction in global scale, IPCC class models.
